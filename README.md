# Padder
**Padder** is a musical instrument based on a virtual pedal that, thanks to the interaction between the different blocks of its architecture, can generate chords that can be played in real time during a musical performance. This kind of approach could be seen as a handsfree way to generate chords, instead of using a piano or a keyboard. For example, it is possible to play the chords with the foot, while you’re playing the guitar and singing at the same time. 
Thanks to the small dimensions of the Arduino board and the sensors, it’s also a more portable instrument than a keyboard or a piano. Moreover, changing the synthesizer parameters, the musician can also create complex and very interesting pad-like sounds.
